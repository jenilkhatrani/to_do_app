# To-Do App in Flutter

This is a simple **To-Do App** built using **Flutter**, leveraging **SQLite** for local data storage and performing **CRUD operations**. The app allows users to add, update, delete, and view tasks. **Provider** is used for state management to efficiently manage the app's state and data flow. This app demonstrates how to integrate a local SQLite database with state management in Flutter.

## Features
